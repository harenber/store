# Store
>Store is a dead simple configuration manager for Go applications.

NOTE:
This fork is maintained by `karanveersp` and includes a bugfix, some extra comments, and a new public function to get the config directory path. This is an updated version of the library made available at [github.com/tucnak/store](https://github.com/tucnak/store). If and when my pull request is merged into the original repo, it is recommended you use that instead of my fork.

I didn't like existing configuration management solutions like [globalconf](https://github.com/rakyll/globalconf), [tachyon](https://github.com/vektra/tachyon) or [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper). First two just don't feel right and viper, imo, a little overcomplicatedâ€”definitely offering too much for small things. Store supports either JSON, TOML or YAML out-of-the-box and lets you register practically any other configuration format. It persists all of your configurations in either $XDG_CONFIG_HOME or $HOME on Linux and in %APPDATA%
on Windows.

Look, when I say it's dead simple, I actually mean it:
```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"time"

	"github.com/karanveersp/store"
)

func init() {
	// You must init store with some truly unique path first!
	store.Init("cats-n-dogs/project-hotel")
}

type Cat struct {
	Name   string `toml:"naym"`
	Clever bool   `toml:"ayy"`
}

type Hotel struct {
	Name string
	Cats []Cat `toml:"guests"`

	Opens  *time.Time
	Closes *time.Time
}

func main() {
	var hotel Hotel

	if err := store.Load("hotel.toml", &hotel); err != nil {
		log.Println("failed to load the cat hotel:", err)
		return
	}

	// ...

	if err := store.Save("hotel.toml", &hotel); err != nil {
		log.Println("failed to save the cat hotel:", err)
		return
	}
}
```

Store supports any other formats via the handy registration system: register the format once and you'd be able to Load and Save files in it afterwards:
```go
store.Register("ini", ini.Marshal, ini.Unmarshal)

err := store.Load("configuration.ini", &object)
// ...
```
